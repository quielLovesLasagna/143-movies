# 143 Movies

## About

This is a project I made to skip time LOL. It was my first time using OMDB API to fetch movie data, since it was my first time, I used _Postman_ to play with it before actually coding. I was going to use Scss in this project but figured that I'd use vanilla CSS3 XD Using BEM for class names was a waste (is what I thought) but this was just to skip time so I did not bother at all, I hard coded some of the Movie data because I did not want to spend most of my time playing with Postman and just wanted to write some code.

Feel free to check it out!
